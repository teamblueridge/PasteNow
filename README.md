PasteIt -- iOS Style  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/teamblueridge/PasteNow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/teamblueridge/PasteNow)
====================

PasteNow is designed to provide an easy way for iOS users to send, and recieve,
data in plain text form. Currently 98% of Stikkid's features are implemented
with the app, with the goal of 100% being attainable.

Initally, the TeamBlueRidge paste server will be used, however, you may configure
the app to utilize any stikkid instance.
